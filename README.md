Topic: Relationship between race/gender diversity and Democratic/ Republican votes in Senate Election

In this study I explore US Senate Votes within years and distribution of US race/gender diversities within the states and study the relationship between distribution of the so-called different communities in each particular state and the winner of the Senate election in that state. The study consists of several pre-processing steps and ultimately concludes in prediction. Finally, implementing classification methods including K Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest, We can reach to a promising winner prediction accuracy.
