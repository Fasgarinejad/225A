Topic: Relationship between race/gender diversity and Democratic/ Republican votes in Senate Election![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78135216/139382175-33d0301e-9d5b-4aec-ba83-a049063bb9a8.png)

In this study I explore US Senate Votes within years and distribution of US race/gender diversities within the states and study the relationship between distribution of the so-called different communities in each particular state and the winner of the Senate election in that state. The study consists of several pre-processing steps and ultimately concludes in prediction. Finally, implementing classification methods including K Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest, We can reach to a promising winner prediction accuracy.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78135216/139382186-367d907e-10b6-46e3-bcda-6bfbac04c52d.png)
